## 📘 Overview

**Curriculum Skill Recommender (CSR)** is designed to identify and recommend relevant skills for academic courses and curricula.

CSR uses **semantic understanding** to align course descriptions with a comprehensive **Skills Taxonomy**, enabling key use cases such as:

- Course → Skills mapping
- Program-level skill mapping and coverage analysis
- Curriculum analysis and gap detection (Hopefully 😊)
